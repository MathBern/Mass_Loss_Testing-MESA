# Massive-Stellar-Evolution--Mass-Loss-and-Red-Supergiants-Properties

This repository has the objective to make public and safely save all the MESA and Python files (including results and tests) used during my FAPERJ Scientific Initiation Project and Undergraduate Project (Evolução de Estrela de Alta Massa: Perdas de Massa e Propriedades de Supergigantes Vermelhas).

The codes and scripts are not fully commented, specially the older files used to learn MESA and tests things I found interesting.

Any questions, please contact me: matheus.b.peron@gmail.com or matheus15@astro.ufrj.br
